  abstract     = {If we take an existing supervised NLP sys- tem, a simple and
                  general way to improve accuracy is to use unsupervised word
                  representations as extra word features. We evaluate Brown
                  clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and HLBL
                  (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words on both NER and
                  chunking. We use near state-of-the-art supervised baselines,
                  and find that each of the three word representations improves
                  the accu- racy of these baselines. We find further
                  improvements by combining diðerent word representations. You
                  can download our word features, for oð-the-shelf use in
                  existing NLP systems, as well as our code, here:

  abstract     = {We present the Word Mover’s Distance (WMD), a novel distance
                  function between text documents. Our work is based on recent
                  results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful
                  representations for words from local co-occurrences in
                  sentences. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between
                  two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the
                  embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the
                  embedded words of another document. We show that this distance
                  metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover’s
                  Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which
                  several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our
                  metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to
                  implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world
                  document classification data sets, in comparison with seven
                  state-of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to
                  unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification
                  error rates.}

  abstract     = "Deep Neural Network has been applied to many Natural Language
                  Processing tasks. Instead of building hand-craft features, DNN
                  builds features by automatic learning, fitting different
                  domains well. In this paper, we propose a novel convolution
                  network, incorporating lexical features, applied to Relation
                  Extraction. Since many current deep neural networks use word
                  embedding by word table, which, however, neglects semantic
                  meaning among words, we import a new coding method, which
                  coding input words by synonym dictionary to integrate semantic
                  knowledge into the neural network. We compared our Convolution
                  Neural Network (CNN) on relation extraction with the
                  state-of-art tree kernel approach, including Typed Dependency
                  Path Kernel and Shortest Dependency Path Kernel and
                  Context-Sensitive tree kernel, resulting in a 9{\%}
                  improvement competitive performance on ACE2005 data set. Also,
                  we compared the synonym coding with the one-hot coding, and
                  our approach got 1.6{\%} improvement. Moreover, we also tried
                  other coding method, such as hypernym coding, and give some
                  discussion according the result.",

                  essential input parameter is the required accuracy of the

                  they automatically ensure the best possible rate of
                  convergence. We confirm our theoretical results by encouraging
                  numerical experiments, which demonstrate that the fast rate of
                  convergence, typical for the smooth optimization problems,

                  people's inability to think in statistical terms when faced
                  with information about a single case. Prior theoretical
                  analyses and empirical results imply that the errors
                  associated with case-specific reasoning may be reduced when
                  people make frequentistic predictions about a set of cases. In
                  studies of three previously identified cognitive biases, we
                  find that frequency-based predictions are different from—but
                  no better than—case-specific judgments of probability. First,
                  in studies of the “planning fallacy,” we compare the
                  accuracy of aggregate frequency and case-specific probability
                  judgments in predictions of students' real-life projects. When
                  aggregate and single-case predictions are collected from
                  different respondents, there is little difference between the
                  two: Both are overly optimistic and show little predictive
                  validity. However, in within-subject comparisons, the
                  aggregate judgments are significantly more conservative than
                  the single-case predictions, though still optimistically
                  biased. Results from studies of overconfidence in general
                  knowledge and base rate neglect in categorical prediction
                  underline a general conclusion. Frequentistic predictions made
                  for sets of events are no more statistically sophisticated,
                  nor more accurate, than predictions made for individual events
                  using subjective probability."

                  parsing which is based on bidirectional-LSTMs (BiLSTMs). Each
                  sentence token is associated with a BiLSTM vector
                  representing the token in its sentential context, and feature
                  vectors are constructed by concatenating a few BiLSTM
                  vectors. The BiLSTM is trained jointly with the parser
                  objective, resulting in very effective feature extractors for
                  parsing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by
                  applying it to a greedy transition-based parser as well as to
                  a globally optimized graph-based parser. The resulting
                  parsers have very simple architectures, and match or surpass
                  the state-of-the-art accuracies on English and Chinese."

                  supervised classification and regression problems. It
                  essentially consists of randomizing strongly both attribute
                  and cut-point choice while splitting a tree node. In the
                  extreme case, it builds totally randomized trees whose
                  structures are independent of the output values of the
                  learning sample. The strength of the randomization can be
                  tuned to problem specifics by the appropriate choice of a
                  parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice
                  of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to
                  adjust it in particular situations. Besides accuracy, the
                  main strength of the resulting algorithm is computational
                  efficiency. A bias/variance analysis of the Extra-Trees
                  algorithm is also provided as well as a geometrical and a
                  kernel characterization of the models induced.",

  abstract     = "In the first part of the paper we consider the problem of
                  dynamically apportioning resources among a set of options in
                  a worst-case on-line framework. The model we study can be
                  interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the
                  well-studied on-line prediction model to a general
                  decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative
                  weight-update Littlestone–Warmuth rule can be adapted to this
                  model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some
                  cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of
                  learning problems. We show how the resulting learning
                  algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including
                  gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and
                  prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper
                  we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive
                  a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not
                  require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak
                  learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new
                  boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose
                  range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set
                  or a bounded segment of the real line."

                  Jordan [Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y. \&amp; Jordan, M. I. (2003)
                  J. Machine Learn. Res. 3, 993-1022], in which each document
                  is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then
                  choosing each word in the document from a topic selected
                  according to this distribution. We then present a Markov
                  chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. We
                  use this algorithm to analyze abstracts from PNAS by using
                  Bayesian model selection to establish the number of
                  topics. We show that the extracted topics capture meaningful

                  examples. Although several techniques exist for dealing with
                  this problem, they all assume that positive examples in the
                  positive set P and the positive examples in the unlabeled set
                  U are generated from the same distribution. This assumption
                  may be violated in practice. For example, one wants to
                  collect all printer pages from the Web. One can use the
                  printer pages from one site as the set P of positive pages
                  and use product pages from another site as U. One wants to
                  classify the pages in U into printer pages and non-printer
                  pages. Although printer pages from the two sites have many
                  similarities, they can also be quite different because
                  different sites often present similar products in different
                  styles and have different focuses. In such cases, existing
                  methods perform poorly. This paper proposes a novel technique
                  A-EM to deal with the problem. Experiment results with
                  product page classification demonstrate the effectiveness of
                  the proposed technique.",

                  window in a word sequence to directly capture contextual
                  features at the word n-gram level. Next, the salient word
                  n-gram features in the word sequence are discovered by the
                  model and are then aggregated to form a sentence-level
                  feature vector. Finally, a non-linear transformation is
                  applied to extract high-level semantic information to
                  generate a continuous vector representation for the full text
                  string. The proposed convolutional latent semantic model
                  (CLSM) is trained on clickthrough data and is evaluated on a
                  Web document ranking task using a large-scale, real-world
                  data set. Results show that the proposed model effectively
                  captures salient semantic information in queries and
                  documents for the task while significantly outperforming
                  previous state-of-the-art semantic models.},

                  traditionally required large amounts of knowledge in the form
                  of feature engineering and lexicons to achieve high
                  performance. In this paper, we present a novel neural network
                  architecture that automatically detects word- and
                  character-level features using a hybrid bidirectional LSTM
                  and CNN architecture, eliminating the need for most feature
                  engineering. We also propose a novel method of encoding
                  partial lexicon matches in neural networks and compare it to
                  existing approaches. Extensive evaluation shows that, given
                  only tokenized text and publicly available word embeddings,
                  our system is competitive on the CoNLL-2003 dataset and
                  surpasses the previously reported state of the art
                  performance on the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset by 2.13 F1
                  points. By using two lexicons constructed from
                  publicly-available sources, we establish new state of the art
                  performance with an F1 score of 91.62 on CoNLL-2003 and 86.28
                  on OntoNotes, surpassing systems that employ heavy feature
                  engineering, proprietary lexicons, and rich entity linking

                  methods, lattice LSTM does not suffer from segmentation

                  with established AF, and have focused on stroke as the

                  alone and stroke or death in community-based individuals with
                  new-onset AF.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective,
                  community-based, observational cohort in Framingham, Mass.
                  We identified 868 participants with new-onset AF, 705 of whom
                  were not treated with warfarin at baseline. Risk scores for
                  stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and stroke or death were
                  developed with censoring when warfarin initiation occurred
                  during follow-up. Event rates were examined in low-risk
                  individuals, as defined by the risk score and 4 previously
                  published risk schemes.Main Outcome MeasuresStroke and the
                  combination of stroke or death.ResultsDuring a mean follow-up
                  of 4.0 years free of warfarin use, stroke alone occurred in
                  83 participants and stroke or death occurred in 382
                  participants.  A risk score for stroke was derived that
                  included the following risk predictors: advancing age, female
                  sex, increasing systolic blood pressure, prior stroke or
                  transient ischemic attack, and diabetes. With the risk score,
                  14.3\\% of the cohort had a predicted 5-year stroke rate
                  ≤7.5\\% (average annual rate ≤1.5\\%), and 30.6\\% of the
                  cohort had a predicted 5-year stroke rate ≤10\\% (average
                  annual rate ≤2\\%). Actual stroke rates in these low-risk
                  groups were 1.1 and 1.5 per 100 person-years,
                  respectively. Previous risk schemes classified 6.4\\% to
                  17.3\\% of subjects as low risk, with actual stroke rates of
                  0.9 to 2.3 per 100 person-years. A risk score for stroke or
                  death is also presented.ConclusionThese risk scores can be
                  used to estimate the absolute risk of an adverse event in
                  individuals with AF, which may be helpful in counseling
                  patients and making treatment decisions.}",

                  requires to question not only with various patterns but also
                  on diverse and relevant topics. We observe that a good
                  question is a natural composition of interrogatives, topic
                  words, and ordinary words. Interrogatives lexicalize the
                  pattern of questioning, topic words address the key
                  information for topic transition in dialogue, and ordinary
                  words play syntactical and grammatical roles in making a
                  natural sentence. We devise two typed decoders (soft typed
                  decoder and hard typed decoder) in which a type distribution
                  over the three types is estimated and the type distribution
                  is used to modulate the final generation
                  distribution. Extensive experiments show that the typed
                  decoders outperform state-of-the-art baselines and can

                  language processing. However, most of the work in the
                  literature concentrate on the methods that are dealing with
                  single relation between two named entities. In the task of
                  multiple relations extraction, traditional statistic-based
                  methods have difficulties in selecting features and improving
                  the performance of extraction model. In this paper, we
                  presented formal definitions of multiple entities and
                  multiple relations and put forward three labeling methods
                  which were used to label entity categories, relation
                  categories and relation conditions. We also proposed a novel
                  relation extraction model which is based on dynamic long
                  short-term memory network. To train our model, entity
                  feature, entity position feature and part of speech feature
                  are used together. These features are used to describe
                  complex relations and improve the performance of relation
                  extraction model. In the experiments, we classified the
                  corpus into three sets which are composed of 0--20 words,
                  20--35 words and 35+ words sentences. On conll04.corp, the
                  final precision, recall rate and F-measure reached 72.9, 70.8

                  extraction model which uses graph convolutional networks
                  (GCNs) to jointly learn named entities and relations. In
                  contrast to previous baselines, we consider the interaction
                  between named entities and relations via a 2nd-phase
                  relation-weighted GCN to better extract relations. Linear and
                  dependency structures are both used to extract both
                  sequential and regional features of the text, and a complete
                  word graph is further utilized to extract implicit features
                  among all word pairs of the text. With the graph-based
                  approach, the prediction for overlapping relations is
                  substantially improved over previous sequential
                  approaches. We evaluate GraphRel on two public datasets: NYT
                  and WebNLG. Results show that GraphRel maintains high
                  precision while increasing recall substantially. Also,
                  GraphRel outperforms previous work by 3.2{\%} and 5.8{\%} (F1

                  and pharmacovigilance. These interactions may cause adverse
                  drug effects that threaten public health and patient
                  safety. Therefore, the DDIs extraction from biomedical
                  literature has been widely studied and emphasized in modern
                  biomedical research. The previous rules-based and machine
                  learning approaches rely on tedious feature engineering,
                  which is labourious, time-consuming and unsatisfactory. With
                  the development of deep learning technologies, this problem
                  is alleviated by learning feature representations
                  automatically. Here, we review the recent deep learning
                  methods that have been applied to the extraction of DDIs from
                  biomedical literature. We describe each method briefly and
                  compare its performance in the DDI corpus
                  systematically. Next, we summarize the advantages and
                  disadvantages of these deep learning models for this
                  task. Furthermore, we discuss some challenges and future
                  perspectives of DDI extraction via deep learning
                  methods. This review aims to serve as a useful guide for
                  interested researchers to further advance bioinformatics
                  algorithms for DDIs extraction from the literature.}",

                  looking at a short span of text within a single sentence
                  containing a single entity pair mention. This approach often
                  does not consider interactions across mentions, requires
                  redundant computation for each mention pair, and ignores
                  relationships expressed across sentence boundaries. These
                  problems are exacerbated by the document- (rather than
                  sentence-) level annotation common in biological text. In
                  response, we propose a model which simultaneously predicts
                  relationships between all mention pairs in a document. We
                  form pairwise predictions over entire paper abstracts using
                  an efficient self-attention encoder. All-pairs mention scores
                  allow us to perform multi-instance learning by aggregating
                  over mentions to form entity pair representations. We further
                  adapt to settings without mention-level annotation by jointly
                  training to predict named entities and adding a corpus of
                  weakly labeled data. In experiments on two Biocreative
                  benchmark datasets, we achieve state of the art performance
                  on the Biocreative V Chemical Disease Relation dataset for
                  models without external KB resources. We also introduce a new
                  dataset an order of magnitude larger than existing
                  human-annotated biological information extraction datasets
                  and more accurate than distantly supervised alternatives."

                  extracted from documents has improved frustratingly
                  slowly. This paper simultaneously addresses two issues that
                  have held back prior work. We first propose an effective new
                  model, which combines an LSTM sequence model with a form of
                  entity position-aware attention that is better suited to
                  relation extraction. Then we build TACRED, a large (119,474
                  examples) supervised relation extraction dataset obtained via
                  crowdsourcing and targeted towards TAC KBP relations. The
                  combination of better supervised data and a more appropriate
                  high-capacity model enables much better relation extraction
                  performance. When the model trained on this new dataset
                  replaces the previous relation extraction component of the
                  best TAC KBP 2015 slot filling system, its F1 score increases
                  markedly from 22.2{\%} to 26.7{\%}."

(2) Can they detect none-of-the-above (NOTA) relations? To construct FewRel 2.0, we build upon the FewRel dataset by adding a new test set in a quite different domain, and a NOTA relation choice. With the new dataset and extensive experimental analysis, we found (1) that the state-of-the-art few-shot relation classification models struggle on these two aspects, and (2) that the commonly-used techniques for domain adaptation and NOTA detection still cannot handle the two challenges well.

                  values from title is a crucial task in e-Commerce
                  domain. Previous studies treat each attribute only as an
                  entity type and build one set of NER tags (e.g., BIO) for
                  each of them, leading to a scalability issue which unfits to
                  the large sized attribute system in real world e-Commerce. In
                  this work, we propose a novel approach to support value
                  extraction scaling up to thousands of attributes without
                  losing performance: (1) We propose to regard attribute as a
                  query and adopt only one global set of BIO tags for any
                  attributes to reduce the burden of attribute tag or model
                  explosion; (2) We explicitly model the semantic
                  representations for attribute and title, and develop an
                  attention mechanism to capture the interactive semantic
                  relations in-between to enforce our framework to be attribute
                  comprehensive. We conduct extensive experiments in real-life
                  datasets. The results show that our model not only
                  outperforms existing state-of-the-art NER tagging models, but
                  also is robust and generates promising results for up to

                  of the main obstacles to develop a high performance Chinese
                  named entity recognition (NER) system. Fortunately, the
                  automatically constructed lexicon contains rich word
                  boundaries information and word semantic
                  information. However, integrating lexical knowledge in
                  Chinese NER tasks still faces challenges when it comes to
                  self-matched lexical words as well as the nearest contextual
                  lexical words. We present a Collaborative Graph Network to
                  solve these challenges. Experiments on various datasets show
                  that our model not only outperforms the state-of-the-art
                  (SOTA) results, but also achieves a speed that is six to
                  fifteen times faster than that of the SOTA model."
