  abstract     = {If we take an existing supervised NLP sys- tem, a simple and
                  general way to improve accuracy is to use unsupervised word
                  representations as extra word features. We evaluate Brown
                  clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and HLBL
                  (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words on both NER and
                  chunking. We use near state-of-the-art supervised baselines,
                  and find that each of the three word representations improves
                  the accu- racy of these baselines. We find further
                  improvements by combining diðerent word representations. You
                  can download our word features, for oð-the-shelf use in
                  existing NLP systems, as well as our code, here:

  abstract     = {We present the Word Mover’s Distance (WMD), a novel distance
                  function between text documents. Our work is based on recent
                  results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful
                  representations for words from local co-occurrences in
                  sentences. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between
                  two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the
                  embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the
                  embedded words of another document. We show that this distance
                  metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover’s
                  Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which
                  several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our
                  metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to
                  implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world
                  document classification data sets, in comparison with seven
                  state-of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to
                  unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification
                  error rates.}

  abstract     = "Deep Neural Network has been applied to many Natural Language
                  Processing tasks. Instead of building hand-craft features, DNN
                  builds features by automatic learning, fitting different
                  domains well. In this paper, we propose a novel convolution
                  network, incorporating lexical features, applied to Relation
                  Extraction. Since many current deep neural networks use word
                  embedding by word table, which, however, neglects semantic
                  meaning among words, we import a new coding method, which
                  coding input words by synonym dictionary to integrate semantic
                  knowledge into the neural network. We compared our Convolution
                  Neural Network (CNN) on relation extraction with the
                  state-of-art tree kernel approach, including Typed Dependency
                  Path Kernel and Shortest Dependency Path Kernel and
                  Context-Sensitive tree kernel, resulting in a 9{\%}
                  improvement competitive performance on ACE2005 data set. Also,
                  we compared the synonym coding with the one-hot coding, and
                  our approach got 1.6{\%} improvement. Moreover, we also tried
                  other coding method, such as hypernym coding, and give some
                  discussion according the result.",

                  essential input parameter is the required accuracy of the
                  solution. At the same time, for each particular problem class
                  they automatically ensure the best possible rate of
                  convergence. We confirm our theoretical results by encouraging
                  numerical experiments, which demonstrate that the fast rate of
                  convergence, typical for the smooth optimization problems,
                  sometimes can be achieved even on nonsmooth problem

                  people's inability to think in statistical terms when faced
                  with information about a single case. Prior theoretical
                  analyses and empirical results imply that the errors
                  associated with case-specific reasoning may be reduced when
                  people make frequentistic predictions about a set of cases. In
                  studies of three previously identified cognitive biases, we
                  find that frequency-based predictions are different from—but
                  no better than—case-specific judgments of probability. First,
                  in studies of the “planning fallacy,” we compare the
                  accuracy of aggregate frequency and case-specific probability
                  judgments in predictions of students' real-life projects. When
                  aggregate and single-case predictions are collected from
                  different respondents, there is little difference between the
                  two: Both are overly optimistic and show little predictive
                  validity. However, in within-subject comparisons, the
                  aggregate judgments are significantly more conservative than
                  the single-case predictions, though still optimistically
                  biased. Results from studies of overconfidence in general
                  knowledge and base rate neglect in categorical prediction
                  underline a general conclusion. Frequentistic predictions made
                  for sets of events are no more statistically sophisticated,
                  nor more accurate, than predictions made for individual events
                  using subjective probability."

                  parsing which is based on bidirectional-LSTMs (BiLSTMs). Each
                  sentence token is associated with a BiLSTM vector
                  representing the token in its sentential context, and feature
                  vectors are constructed by concatenating a few BiLSTM
                  vectors. The BiLSTM is trained jointly with the parser
                  objective, resulting in very effective feature extractors for
                  parsing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by
                  applying it to a greedy transition-based parser as well as to
                  a globally optimized graph-based parser. The resulting
                  parsers have very simple architectures, and match or surpass
                  the state-of-the-art accuracies on English and Chinese."

                  supervised classification and regression problems. It
                  essentially consists of randomizing strongly both attribute
                  and cut-point choice while splitting a tree node. In the
                  extreme case, it builds totally randomized trees whose
                  structures are independent of the output values of the
                  learning sample. The strength of the randomization can be
                  tuned to problem specifics by the appropriate choice of a
                  parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice
                  of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to
                  adjust it in particular situations. Besides accuracy, the
                  main strength of the resulting algorithm is computational
                  efficiency. A bias/variance analysis of the Extra-Trees
                  algorithm is also provided as well as a geometrical and a
                  kernel characterization of the models induced.",

  abstract     = "In the first part of the paper we consider the problem of
                  dynamically apportioning resources among a set of options in
                  a worst-case on-line framework. The model we study can be
                  interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the
                  well-studied on-line prediction model to a general
                  decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative
                  weight-update Littlestone–Warmuth rule can be adapted to this
                  model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some
                  cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of
                  learning problems. We show how the resulting learning
                  algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including
                  gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and
                  prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper
                  we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive
                  a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not
                  require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak
                  learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new
                  boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose
                  range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set
                  or a bounded segment of the real line."
